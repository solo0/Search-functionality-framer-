# Search-functionality-framer-

Recently I`ve decided to use Framer in my projects and I have to say, I`ve been blown away with it`s possibilities. Currently I`ll be working on parsing the JSON with entered value and showing the result, to prototype it as a real working search. That was a really fun experience and I will continue using Framer for my other projects.

This shot is a rebound of an amazing prototype by Taylor Palmer, I`ve used the same live data (using JSON) and added (https://github.com/ajimix/Input-Framer) input module by Adria Jimenez and (https://github.com/ServusJon/SVGCircle-Module-for-FramerJS) circle module for svg animation on processing your search by Jonathan Arnold.

You can play around with the prototype yourself by following the link below: https://framer.cloud/xNAJg
